        <h1>Forex trading strategy</h1>
        <p>
            In the spirit of technical analysis - a forex strategy is a combination of technical
            indicators that raise buy and sell signals at certain time and at certain price.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Entry and Exit strategies</h1>
        <p>
            A forex trading strategy can be divided on two main parts:<br />
            - Entry strategy - represents the logic of opening (averaging) a position.<br />
            - Exit strategy - represents the logic of closing the existing position.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Entry strategy</h1>
        <p>
            The entry strategy is represented by the <i>"Opening Point of the Position"</i>
            and <i>"Opening Logic Condition"</i> slots.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Exit strategy</h1>
        <p>
            The exit strategy is represented by the <i>"Closing Point of the Position"</i> and
            <i>"Closing Logic Condition"</i> slots.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Opening Point of the Position" slot</h1>
        <p>
            This is the first strategy slot. Its indicator shows the entry price of opening or averaging
            a position.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Opening Logic Condition" slot</h1>
        <p>
            Every <i>"Opening Logic Condition"</i> slot contains a logic condition. It serves
            as an entry filter. An entry signal can be raised when all the
            <i>"Opening Logic Conditions"</i> are fulfilled.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Closing Point of the Position" slot</h1>
        <p>
            This is the first exit strategy slot. Its indicator shows the exit
            price of closing the existing position.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Closing Logic Condition"</h1>
        <p>
            We can use a <i>"Closing Logic Condition"</i> when the
            <i>"Closing point of the position"</i> slot contains <i>"Bar Closing"</i> only.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Closing logic condition" slot</h1>
        <p>
            Every <i>"Closing logic condition"</i> slot contains a logic condition. It serves
            as an exit trigger. An exit signal will be raised when one of the
            <i>"Closing logic conditions"</i> is fulfilled.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Adding a strategy slot</h1>
        <p>
            You can add new logic condition slots only. Opening and Closing point of the position
            slots are permanent. Maximum number of logic slots is four Opening and two Closing
            slots. A Closing logic condition slot is available when closing point is "Bar Closing"
            only.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Removing a strategy slot</h1>
        <p>
            Remove a logic slot by pressing its closing button. You cannot remove the Opening
            and Closing point of the position slots. They are permanent.<br />
            All present <i>"Closing logic condition"</i> slots will be removed if you
            make <i>"Closing point of the position"</i> different from <i>"Bar Closing"</i>.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Edit the slot indicator</h1>
        <p>
            To open the indicator parameters dialogue simply click on the indicator slot. You
            will be able to choose a new indicator according to the type of the slot.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Changing the strategy slots representation</h1>
        <p>
            You can change the layout of all strategy slots by means of the three small
            square buttons above the strategy slots. They change the view only and do not affect
            your strategy in any way.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Same and Opposite direction signals</h1>
        <p>
            Same and Opposite direction signals are additional signals raised from the Entry strategy
            during a position. A change of their logic directly changes the strategy behaviour.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Same direction signal</h1>
        <p>
            Same direction signal is another buy signal during a long position or another sell
            signal during a short position.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Same direction signal - "Nothing"</h1>
        <p>
            This logic means that all additional signals in the direction of your position will
            be cancelled. There is no way to add more lots to the initial position in this case.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Same direction signal - "Winner"</h1>
        <p>
            "Winner" option means that the program will allow adding to a profitable position.
			The adding can be cancelled if the maximum number of open lots was reached.
			No adding is allowed to a losing position.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Same direction signal - "Add"</h1>
        <p>
            This logic allows the Entry strategy to raise additional signals toward the initial
            position direction and to increase its amount in lots. <b>Forex Strategy Trader</b>
            will average the price of the market position.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Opposite direction signal</h1>
        <p>
            Opposite direction signal is a buy signal during a short position or a
            sell signal during a long position. It has to be raised from the Entry strategy only.
            A closing signal from the Exit strategy is not an opposite direction signal.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Opposite direction signal - "Nothing"</h1>
        <p>
            This logic means that all additional signals in the opposite direction of your position
            will be cancelled. There is no way to close lots from the initial position in this case.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Opposite direction signal - "Reduce"</h1>
        <p>
            The Entry logic will reduce your market position with one lot in case of an opposite
            signal. Of course, this means that if your position amount is one lot only, it will
            be closed.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Opposite direction signal - "Close"</h1>
        <p>
            In case of an opposite signal raised by the Entry strategy <b>Forex Strategy Trader</b>
            will close your present position no matter of its amount.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Opposite direction signal - "Reverse"</h1>
        <p>
            An Entry strategy <i>opposite direction signal</i> closes the current position
            and opens a new opposite one. The amount of the opposite position will be one lot.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Entry strategy signals</h1>
        <p>
            The entry signals depend on the same and opposite signals logic. In case of adding
            to a position, the execution can be cancelled by the "Lot Limiter" if the number
            of position lots reaches the limit.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Exit strategy signals</h1>
        <p>
            The signals raised by the Exit strategy are independent from the logic of the same
            and opposite signal menus (as they concern the entry strategy only).
			An exit strategy signal can be cancelled when there is
            no position or when its direction is the same as the current position direction.
        </p>
